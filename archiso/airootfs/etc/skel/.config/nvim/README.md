### This config is a full IDE setup.  You can fork this repo and change the configs. Also you can contribute to this repo.

> If you want to change the dashboard just copy paste ASCII Text from any website and paste there.

## What you need to do for using all the features of this neovim?

 - **For using Emmet,** you need to install **ls_emmet**. Using this command`sudo npm install -g ls_emmet`.
 - **For using LSP completion** for a particular language, you need to install them first. Like you opened a python file in nvim, then first you need to go into command mode and type `LspInstall python`. It will show you option for language server for this language(any language you typed instead of python).
 - **npm and yarn must be installed.**
 - install **neovim v 0.6** or greater.
 - *For using eslint and prettier, I'll make a video :).*
